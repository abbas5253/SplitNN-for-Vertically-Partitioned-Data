    "# SplitNN for Vertically Partitioned Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Recap: The previous tutorial looked at building a basic SplitNN, where an NN was split into two segments on two seperate hosts. However, what if clients have multi-modal multi-institutional collaboration?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is Vertically Partitioned Data?</b> Data is said to be vertically partitioned when several organizations own different attributes or modalities of information for the same set of entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why use Partitioned Data?</b> Partition allows for orgnizations holding different modalities of data to learn distributed models without data sharing. Partitioning scheme is traditionally used to reduce the size of data by splitting and distribute to each client.\n",
    " \n",
    "<b>Description</b>This configuration allows for multiple clients holding different modalities of data to learn distributed models without data sharing. As a concrete example we walkthrough the case where radiology centers collaborate with pathology test centers and a server for disease diagnosis. Radiology centers holding imaging data modalities train a partial model upto the cut layer. In the same way the pathology test center having patient test results trains a partial model upto its own cut layer. The outputs at the cut layer from both these centers are then concatenated and sent to the disease diagnosis server that trains the rest of the model. This process is continued back and forth to complete the forward and backward propagations in order to train the distributed deep learning model without sharing each others raw data. In this tutorial, we split a single flatten image into two segments to mimic different modalities of data, you can also split it into arbitrary number.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate the SplitNN architecture with 2 segments[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00564)].This time:\n",

    "    - Has model Segment 1\n",
    "    - Has the handwritten images segment 2\n",
    "- <b>$Server$</b> \n",
    "    - Has Model Segment 2\n",
